          <hr class="small">
          <p>Widely regarded as one of the best Formula One drivers of all time, German-born Michael Schumacher is probably best known for his eleven-year stint at Ferrari, where he won five consecutive F1 titles between 2000 and 2004. <br /><br /> Despite
            being retired since 2012, Schumacher still holds many of Formula One's driver records, including most championships, race victories, fastest laps, pole positions and most races won in a single season.

          <h2><em>Tragedy Strikes</em></h2>
          <hr class="small">
          <p class="padding-20px">On 29 December 2013, Schumacher was skiing with his 14-year-old son Mick descending the Combe de Saulire below the Dent de Burgin above MÃ©ribel in the French Alps. While crossing an unsecured off-piste area between Piste Chamois and Piste Mauduit
            he fell and hit his head on a rock, sustaining a head injury despite wearing a ski helmet. <br><br />According to his physicians, he would most likely have died had he not been wearing a helmet. Schumacher was put into a medically induced
            coma because of traumatic brain injury; his doctors reported on 7 March 2014 that his condition was stable. <br><br />On 4 April 2014, Schumacher's agent reported that he was showing "moments of consciousness" as he was gradually withdrawn
            from the medically induced coma, adding to reports by relatives of "small encouraging signs" over the preceding month. In mid-June he was moved from intensive care into a rehabilitation ward. <br><br />By 16 June 2014, Schumacher had regained
            consciousness and left Grenoble Hospital for further rehabilitation at the University Hospital (CHUV) in Lausanne, Switzerland. On 9 September 2014, Schumacher left CHUV and was brought back to his home for further rehabilitation. <br><br
            />In November 2014, it was reported that Schumacher was "paralysed and in a wheelchair"; he "cannot speak and has memory problems". In a video interview released in May 2015, Schumacher's manager Sabine Kehm said that his condition is slowly
            improving "considering the severeness of the injury he had".<br><br /> In September 2016, Felix Damm, Schumacher's lawyer, told a German court that his client "cannot walk", in response to false reports from December 2015 in German publication
            Die Bunte that he could "walk a couple of steps".
